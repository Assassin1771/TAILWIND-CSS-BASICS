TAILWIND CSS 

=> UTILITY FIRST CSS FRAMEWORK
(Instead of creating a selector and writing inside it, add all code as inline styling)

=> INSTEAD OF USING PRE DEFINED COMPONENTS AS IN BOOTSTRAP AND MATERIAL UI, HERE WE CAN CUSTOMISE OUR COMPONENTS AND THUS, MAKE IT LOOK DIFFERENT FROM NORMAL COMPONENTS.

=> BASED ON UTILITIES INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS

=> REALLY QUICK

=> HELPS TO ADD CSS FUNCTIONALITIES WITHOUT LEAVING HTML

=> LATEST VERSION OF TAILWIND USES JIT COMPILER (JUST IN TIME). LOADS CSS JUST WHEN NEEDED. HELPS REDUCE LOAD.
